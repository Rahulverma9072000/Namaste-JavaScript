1 doubt i am checking scopes in console of browser so i noticed that let and const is initialised under Script and var is inside Global so in the example //Illegal Shadowing let a = 20; { var a = 20; //Syntax Error } let is under Script and var will be under Global how conflict happens


Great observation 👌 — this doubt happens to almost everyone who inspects scopes in Chrome DevTools.

You noticed:

let / const → appear under “Script” scope

var → appears inside “Global / Window”

Yet this code is illegal:
let a = 20;
{
   var a = 20;   // ❌ SyntaxError
}


✅ Truth: They are NOT different scopes

Chrome DevTools UI makes it look like different scopes,
but internally they both belong to the SAME Global Scope.

At the spec level, the Global scope is implemented using:

🧠 Global Environment Record =

Object Record + Declarative Record

Part	What goes inside
Object Record	var + function declarations (attached to window in browsers)
Declarative Record	let, const, class (NOT on window)

Chrome shows them separately as:

Global (object record → window)

Script (declarative record)

But they are part of the same environment, not separate scopes.
