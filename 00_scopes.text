✅ var, let, const Scope Summary

🔹 var
Function scoped

Not block scoped
If declared outside function → becomes global
Added to window / global object
Hoisted → initialized as undefined


🔹 let
Block scoped {}
Can be global but NOT added to window/global object
Hoisted but NOT initialized → Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
Cannot be redeclared in same scope

🔹 const
Block scoped {} (same scope rules as let)
Must be initialized when declared
Cannot be reassigned
Not added to window/global
Hoisted but NOT initialized → TDZ



⭐ One-Liner Memory Trick

var = function/global scope + window + hoisted with undefined
let / const = block scope + TDZ + not on window
